                    Jenjen Luxury wigs is responsible for all card transactions
                    made on our website. Card payments are processed using
                    Elavon Merchant Services and all credit card details are
                    entered on a secure page and are transferred using SSL to
                    secure and encrypt all data. Dispatch times may vary
                    according to availability and any guarantees or
                    representations made as to delivery times are subject to any
                    delays resulting from postal delays or force majeure for
                    which we will not be responsible. Whilst we try and ensure
                    that all details, descriptions and prices which appear on
                    this website are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover
                    an error in the price of any goods which you have ordered we
                    will inform you of this as soon as possible and give you the
                    option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or
                    cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat
                    the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already
                    paid for the goods, you will receive a full refund.
                </p>

                <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the nature of our products, all sales are final.
                    Refunds are not allowed, however exchanges may be accepted
                    subject to the following terms and conditions. If, for any
                    reason you are unhappy with your products purchased we will
                    agree to exchange any purchased product for another product
                    of an equal value or offer store credit if the product is
                    returned within 72 hours after the recorded receipt of the
                    item. We will not accept any returns or exchanges of any
                    products if the wig has been worn. All shipping, handling
                    costs and money transfer fees will be at the customer's
                    expense therefore we suggest sending through a courier that
                    provides tracking information and delivery confirmation
                    since we are not responsible for lost packages. We must
                    receive the merchandise before an exchange can be made.
                    Products will not be accepted for returns or exchanges if
                    they have been worn, styled, cut (lace or hair), or had
                    products applied to them such as glue or hair products. In a
                    case where any of the conditions above are not met, we
                    reserve the right to refuse an exchange.
                </p>

                <h3>Pricing</h3>
                <p>
                    The price for each product is stated in United State Dollars
                    (USD). The price in Dollars can be converted to a number of
                    different currencies. We try to ensure that all prices
                    quoted are accurate. The cost of foreign products and
                    services may fluctuate and all prices advertised are subject
                    to such changes. However, if a pricing error occurs we will
                    notify you via email detailing the change.
